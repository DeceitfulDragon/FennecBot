# FennecBot
a Discord bot written in Node and JavaScript.
FennecBot was started when I decided I wanted to learn Node.
I had basic JavaScript knowledge at the time, so I also strived to take the time and learn more about it while working with Node.js.
I decided to put the bot up on Github for others to view and learn from the code.

The bot is currently in development, along with this Readme.md file (Expect changes!)

## Notice
The Bot will not work correctly from just cloning the git repository, as a few functions that depend on the SQlite3 files will be missing.
However, you can use a working version of the bot on the [RBS Discord Server](https://discord.gg/jEWvsN9).


## Built With:
* [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org) - For Discord API Functionality.
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) - Language that the bot is built in
* [Better-SQLite3](https://github.com/JoshuaWise/better-sqlite3) - For the database
* Various other NPM packages (See the node package)
