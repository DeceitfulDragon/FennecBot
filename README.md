# FennecBot
a Discord bot written in Node and JavaScript.
FennecBot was started when I decided I wanted to learn Node.
I had basic JavaScript knowledge at the time, so I also strived to take the time and learn more about it while working with Node.js.
I decided to put the bot up on Github for others to view and learn from the code.

The bot is currently in development, along with this Readme.md file (Expect changes!)

## Notice
Cloning the repository will not work, as certain files using SQLite3 will be missing.

## Usage

## Built With:
* [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org) - For Discord API Functionality.
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) - Language that the bot is built in
