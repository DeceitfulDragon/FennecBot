# FennecBot
a Discord bot written in Node and JavaScript.
FennecBot was started when I decided I wanted to learn Node.
I had basic JavaScript knowledge at the time, so I also strived to take the time and learn more about it while working with Node.js.
I decided to put the bot up on Github for others to view and learn from the code.

The bot is currently in development, along with this Readme.md file (Expect changes!)

## Notice
The Bot will not work correctly from just cloning the git repository, as a few functions that depend on the SQlite3 files will be missing.
However, you can use a working version of the bot on the [RBS Discord Server](https://discord.gg/jEWvsN9).

**Extra Note:** The bot is currently not hosted properly, as I'm trying to get it hosted on my Raspberry Pi, so expect for the bot to not be online 24/7.	

## Usage
Default prefix is '//'.
